Obviously Chrome Documentation is useful keep studying that


Can read the errors and background.js noise in chrome://extensions inspect views

Fix this:

Error in event handler for (unknown): TypeError: Cannot read property 'farewell' of undefined
    at chrome-extension://lcbeacbmkhgdocdbodjmeibgeopejjji/background.js:20:17





Planned Control Flow of Extension:

-Content Scripts fire (website data,)
-- Content Sends Data to Background and Other script sends data to Background
--- Data is sent both to content.js and popup.js
---- DOM of content.js is replaced or "fixed"
